# Anti-Patterns

## Critical
- Do not use emojis anywhere in generated UI/code/content.
- Do not use AI-purple defaults, neon glows, or oversaturated accent spam.
- Do not use pure black (`#000000`); use tuned dark neutrals.
- Do not use `Inter` as default premium/creative voice.
- Do not use serif in dashboard/software contexts.
- Do not ship generic "three equal cards" marketing rows by default.
- Do not output broken or random Unsplash links.
- Do not leave shadcn/ui as untouched defaults when used.

## Defaults
- Avoid oversized screaming H1s; control hierarchy through rhythm, contrast, and weight.
- Avoid excessive gradient-text headlines.
- Avoid custom cursor effects that hurt accessibility/performance.
- Avoid generic filler copy and buzzword-heavy "AI marketing" language.
- Avoid fake-perfect numbers (e.g., `99.99%`, `50%`) when realism is expected.
- Avoid placeholder names/brands that read like template residue.
- Avoid generic avatar placeholders when realistic context is expected.
- Avoid awkward spacing drift; enforce clear mathematical rhythm in paddings/margins.

## Optional
- Prefer differentiated hero structures over centered-title-over-image repetition.
- Favor memorable interaction signatures over superficial gradient gimmicks.
- Use stable image placeholders such as `https://picsum.photos/seed/{seed}/800/600` when real assets are unavailable.
