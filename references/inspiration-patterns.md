# Inspiration Patterns (Long Catalog)

Non-critical creative catalog to restore broad idea coverage from the pre-refactor monolith.
Use this for exploration after core guardrails are satisfied.

## Navigation & Menus
- Mac-style dock magnification nav
- Magnetic CTA/button pull effect
- Gooey expanding action menu
- Dynamic-island style status capsule
- Contextual radial action menu
- Floating speed-dial action hub
- Mega-menu with staged reveal choreography

## Layout & Structure
- Asymmetric split hero (text/media tension)
- Bento 2.0 uneven tile systems
- Masonry content rhythms
- Chroma/gradient border grid accents
- Opposing split-scroll panels
- Curtain reveal page transitions

## Cards & Containers
- Parallax tilt cards (subtle, performance-safe)
- Cursor-reactive spotlight borders
- Refraction-grade glass panels
- Holographic foil surface accents
- Swipe-stack card interactions
- Morphing trigger-to-modal transitions

## Scrolltelling Patterns
- Sticky stack reveals
- Vertical-to-horizontal gallery translation
- Timeline-sequenced narrative scroll
- Zoom parallax focal storytelling
- SVG path draw-on-scroll progress
- Liquid/wipe section transitions

## Media & Gallery Systems
- 3D dome/perspective galleries
- Coverflow-like centered carousels
- Drag-to-pan infinite canvases
- Accordion image strips
- Hover image trails
- RGB glitch micro-bursts (sparing use)

## Typography & Text Motion
- Kinetic marquee bands
- Text-mask video reveals
- Text scramble/decode effects
- Circular path typography
- Animated gradient stroke headings
- Cursor-reactive letter grids

## Micro-Interactions
- Particle confirmation bursts
- Liquid pull-to-refresh analogs
- Shimmer skeleton loaders
- Direction-aware hover fills
- Coordinate-origin ripple feedback
- SVG line self-draw moments
- Mesh-gradient breathing backgrounds
- Depth-of-field blur layering

## Dashboard / Data Interaction Concepts
- Auto-prioritizing intelligent list
- Typing command bar with processing state
- Live status chip with breathing pulse
- Seamless horizontal metric stream
- Contextual floating action rail

## Mood-to-Pattern Mapping
- **Confident / Executive**: asymmetric hero, diffusion shadows, restrained motion, precise typography
- **Futuristic / Tech**: chroma grids, subtle neon accents, timeline reveals, dense data rhythm
- **Creative / Expressive**: collage asymmetry, kinetic text, richer motion choreography
- **Calm / Editorial**: high whitespace, restrained transitions, serif-sans contrast

## Anti-Slop Reminder
Use this catalog to increase originality, not complexity theater.
- Keep one signature idea per section.
- Prioritize readability and speed over spectacle.
- Respect reduced-motion and mobile fallbacks.
- Keep transform/opacity-first animation discipline.
