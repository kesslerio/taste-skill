# antislopfrontend

> A Creative Technologist skill for AI agents. Build interfaces that feel like physical objects, avant-garde magazines, or precision instruments. **Eradicate AI Slop.**

---

## What is this?

This is an **AI Agent Skill** — a structured set of instructions, patterns, and examples that teaches an AI coding assistant to produce frontend code that transcends generic templates.

The skill enforces:
- **Anti-pattern guards** against the most common "AI Slop" failures
- **Three distinct aesthetic modes**: Editorial, Precision Instrument, Installation
- **Advanced techniques**: Kinetic typography, immersive scrolling, magnetic micro-interactions
- **A quality assurance checklist** that runs before every output

## How to Use with an AI Agent

Drop this repo into your agent's skill directory (`.agent/skills/anti-slop-frontend/`). The agent will automatically read `SKILL.md` when frontend work is requested.

### Trigger Examples

> "Build a portfolio landing page" → Agent picks **Mode A: Editorial**  
> "Create a metrics dashboard" → Agent picks **Mode B: Precision Instrument**  
> "Make a product launch page" → Agent picks **Mode C: Installation**

## The Three Modes

| Mode | For | Vibe |
|------|-----|------|
| **A — Editorial** | Portfolios, blogs, content | Printed fashion magazine, come alive |
| **B — Precision Instrument** | Dashboards, tools, data | Braun calculator, Teenage Engineering |
| **C — Installation** | Landing pages, experiences | Browser as a canvas for art |

## The Forbidden List (Quick)

- ❌ Purple-to-blue gradients
- ❌ Neon glow box-shadows  
- ❌ Glassmorphism as default
- ❌ Bento grids
- ❌ Pill badges
- ❌ White card + gray border + drop shadow
- ❌ Everything centered
- ❌ Rocket/shield icons
