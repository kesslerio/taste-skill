# Taste-Skill (High-Agency Frontend)

This project gives your AI (like Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini) good taste. It stops the AI from generating boring, generic, "slop" code and forces it to build modern, high-end interfaces.

Right now, this whole system runs on just one single file: `SKILL.md`.

## How to Install

You don't need to clone this whole project or do any complex setup. You just need the file.

1. Download the `SKILL.md` file from this repository.
2. Put it into your project folder.
3. Tell your AI (in your prompt or chat): *"Please read and strictly follow the rules in `SKILL.md`."* (In editors like Cursor, you can just `@SKILL.md`).

That's it. The AI will read the file and instantly upgrade how it writes frontend code.

## The 3 Control Dials

At the very top of `SKILL.md`, you will find three settings. They look like this:
* `DESIGN_VARIANCE: 8`
* `MOTION_INTENSITY: 6`
* `VISUAL_DENSITY: 4`

You can change these numbers from `1` to `10` depending on what you want to build. Here is what they actually do:

### 1. DESIGN_VARIANCE (1 to 10)
This controls how crazy or normal the layout looks.
* **1 to 3 (Normal):** Very safe, centered layouts. Standard grids where everything lines up perfectly.
* **4 to 7 (Creative):** Things overlap a bit. Text might be pushed to the side, images have different sizes.
* **8 to 10 (Wild):** Asymmetric layouts, huge empty spaces, masonry grids. Very artsy and modern.

### 2. MOTION_INTENSITY (1 to 10)
This controls how much stuff moves on the screen.
* **1 to 3 (Static):** Almost no movement. Just simple color changes when you hover over a button.
* **4 to 7 (Smooth):** Nice fade-ins when the page loads. Smooth scrolling.
* **8 to 10 (Cinematic):** Buttons that magnetic-pull to your mouse. Elements that pop in with spring physics. Advanced scrolling effects.

### 3. VISUAL_DENSITY (1 to 10)
This controls how packed the screen is.
* **1 to 3 (Airy):** Huge amounts of white space. Very clean, like an art gallery or a fashion portfolio.
* **4 to 7 (Standard):** Normal spacing for a standard website or web app.
* **8 to 10 (Packed):** Like a pilot's cockpit or a crypto trading dashboard. Lots of data, tiny text, thin lines, everything packed close together so you can see a lot of information at once.
